## Exercise 1 - Variables
- [ ] Read the following page: https://www.java-made-easy.com/java-variables.html
- [ ] Assign the correct primitive type (int, string, char, boolean, double) to the following variables:
	- "House" 
	- 56
	- 12.34
	- 766
	- "c" 
	- False
	- "Car" 
	- "This is a sentence" 
	- 8.4444
	- True

- [ ] Let's say we want to write a program about the following things. Which primitive type would you use for each class of objects?
	- For Example: The age of all my friends - you should use the type 'int' because the age is normally stated as a natural ("whole") number like 18,23 and so on and 
	  not a decimal number. 
	- Names of all your friends
	- The 12 months of the year
	- The price of the products in a supermarket
	- A list of all people doing cross fit in Cologne
	- The grades uses by an english school (A,B,C,D,F)
	- A list of whether your friends have a drivers liscense or not 

- [ ] Correct the erros in the code, so that the code runs without problems. You should get the following output:
Luisa is 18 years old and has a drivers liscense: true
When going to REWE in the category F you can buy an apple for 1.99

- [ ] Write 3 lines of code to:
   1. save a variable int x as a number 
   2. save a variable int y as a number
   3. print out the sum of the two numbers 

- [ ] Do the same for difference, multiplication and division
